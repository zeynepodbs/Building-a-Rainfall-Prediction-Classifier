# Building a Rainfall Prediction Classifier

This project develops a **machine learning model** to predict whether it will rain tomorrow using the *Australian Weather Dataset*.  
The analysis includes **data preprocessing, feature selection, model building, evaluation, and visualization**.  
Developed as part of the **IBM Data Science Professional Certificate (Coursera)** final project.

---

## Project Overview
The notebook performs the following steps:
- Load and explore the Australian weather dataset  
- Handle missing values and outliers  
- Feature engineering (categorical encoding, normalization)  
- Build multiple classification models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)  
- Evaluate models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score  
- Visualize feature importances and performance metrics

## Tools & Libraries
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for visualization  
- **Jupyter Notebook**

## Dataset
**Dataset:** Australian Weather Dataset  
**Source:** IBM Skills Network / Coursera public repository
